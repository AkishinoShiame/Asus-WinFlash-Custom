* How to flash with custom ROM *

1. Download the last revision of your BIOS at Asus website.
2. Download AMIBCP 4.53
3. Modify whatever you want then save as "Modified.REV", ex: (XF750J.208 to MODIFIED.208)
4. Open notepad++ and write some char and let notepad open without saving.
4. Run patched WinFlash and select the untouched BIOS data
5. Clic exit
6. When Windows say that notepad does not allow shutdown, clic on "abord".
7. (Optionnal) If you have USBChargerPlus on your laptop, you should restart it (C:\Program Files x86\Asus\..)
8. Run patched WinFlash again, this time select the modified BIOS data then clic Flash and exit.
9. Your laptop should flash the custom ROM, if not, you'll have to wait.

* !! NOTE !! *
If WinFlash does not recognize your ROM DO NOT TRY TO FLASH YOUR LAPTOP ! Risk of brick.
Don't do it unless you have a SPIFlasher in hand with backup..
